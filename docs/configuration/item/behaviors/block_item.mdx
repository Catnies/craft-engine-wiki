## Introduction

**Block Item** is an item that is bound to a block. You can configure its corresponding block ID here, or even the entire block configuration. When you bind this behavior to an item, you can place it by right-clicking.

```yaml
items:
  default:palm_sapling:
    behavior:
      type: block_item
      block: default:palm_sapling

blocks:
  default:palm_sapling:
    behavior: ...
    settings: ...
    states: ...
    loot: ...
    events: ...
```

or

```yaml
items:
  default:palm_sapling:
    behavior:
      type: block_item
      block: 
        behavior: ...
        settings: ...
        states: ...
        loot: ...
        events: ...
```

:::tip
Other **Block Item** based variant behaviors can also be configured in this format.
