**Hanging Block** is a type of block that must be attached beneath another block. If the block above it is destroyed, the hanging block itself will also break.

```yml
blocks:
  default:stalactites:
    behavior:
      type: hanging_block
      stackable: false
      blacklist: false # use blacklist mode
      above-block-tags: []
      above-blocks: []
      delay: 0
```
