**Crop Block** is a type of block that grows over time. When receiving random ticks, it has a chance to advance to the next growth stage. However, if the plant lacks sufficient light, it will either stop growing or drop as an item. 

```yml
blocks:
  default:ender_pearl_flower:
    behavior:
      type: crop_block
      grow-speed: 0.25  # 0~1, the chance of growing on random tick
      light-requirement: 9  # light requirement for this crop
      is-bone-meal-target: true # default true
      bone-meal-age-bonus:
        type: uniform
        min: 1
        max: 3
```
