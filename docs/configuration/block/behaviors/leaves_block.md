**Leaves blocks** are blocks that naturally decay after detaching from the tree trunk. When `persistent` is set to true, they will never decay. The `distance` property determines the maximum allowed distance from the trunk.

```yml
blocks:
  default:palm_leaves:
    behavior:
      type: leaves_block
```

:::tip

You can increase or decrease the distance value as needed. For particularly large trees, to prevent leaf decay, you can set the distance to 10 or higher. In the vanilla game, the maximum distance for leaves is 7.
