:::info

Host your resource pack on an external server.
This eliminates bandwidth consumption on your own server.

Typically, after uploading your resource pack to a hosting platform, it will provide you with:

- URL
- UUID (Optional)
- SHA1 (Optional)

Simply fill these three fields with the corresponding values.

:::caution

Note that regular resource pack updates are required to maintain version integrity. This maintenance procedure requires manual intervention.
