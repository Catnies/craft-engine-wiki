## What is CraftEngine

CraftEngine enables you to customize your Minecraft server experience by allowing the creation of new blocks, items, and recipes. All this can be achieved solely through a resource pack and server-side implementation, eliminating the need for any client-side mod installations.

:::info

CraftEngine comes with a full set of block behavior APIs, letting you register custom block behaviors just like in Forge/Fabric. If you‚Äôve ever been a mod developer, you‚Äôll feel right at home with CraftEngine‚Äôs registration system! We recommend using [PaperWeight](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight) as your go-to development dependency.

## Obtaining the Plugin
- The Community Edition is available for download on <Highlight color="#3CB371"><ColoredLink to="https://modrinth.com/plugin/craftengine" color="#ffffff">**Modrinth**</ColoredLink></Highlight>
- The Premium Edition can be purchased on <Highlight color="#2E8B57"><ColoredLink to="https://polymart.org/product/7624/craftengine" color="#ffffff">**Polymart**</ColoredLink></Highlight>

## Installation

CraftEngine requires a <Highlight color="#1877F2"><ColoredLink to="https://papermc.io/downloads/paper" color="#ffffff">**Paper**</ColoredLink></Highlight> based Minecraft server to function. It is compatible with most common forks, including <Highlight color="#1877F2"><ColoredLink to="https://papermc.io/downloads/folia" color="#ffffff">**Folia**</ColoredLink></Highlight>, Pufferfish, Purpur and similar variants.
To install the plugin, simply drag and drop the .jar file into your server's /plugins folder.

:::info

CraftEngine requires JDK 21 or later to run. The minimum supported Minecraft version is 1.20, though this may be dropped in future updates depending on [NetEase](https://minecraft.wiki/w/China_Edition)'s Minecraft server version support in China.

## Key Differentiators
CraftEngine's underlying implementation principle is fundamentally different from competing products in the same category. If you're curious about the technical details, you can review our code on GitHub for deeper understanding.

In simpler terms:
- CraftEngine achieves server-side modding, enabling the creation of new blocks that surpass the current Minecraft version's limitations
- Using an implementation approach similar to ViaBackwards, it converts these new blocks into legacy block formats that remain visible to players
