## Introduction

Block behavior refers to a block's unique mechanics and physics. Some block behaviors work based on some properties. For example:
- Crop blocks need an `age` property to track growth stages
- Doors require a `hinge` property to determine left/right part

In subsequent pages, you'll find a table header like this one, specifying the property names and types required by this block behavior.

| Property Name | Property Type | Required |
|---------|---------|---------|
| facing   | direction   | yes   |
| waterlogged   | boolean   | no   |

:::info

Future versions may support custom property names, but the current implementation uses hardcoded names for simpler configuration.

## Composite Behaviors

You can combine multiple behaviors to create composite behaviors. Below are examples of single-behavior and multi-behavior blocks.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:fairy_flower:
    behavior:
      type: bush_block
      bottom-block-tags:
        - minecraft:dirt
        - minecraft:farmland
```
```yml
blocks:
  default:gunpowder_block:
    behaviors:
      - type: concrete_powder_block
        solid-block: default:solid_gunpowder_block
      - type: falling_block
```

:::warning

Please note: combining some block behaviors may cause unexpected conflicts. If you run into problems, please contact support and we will try to resolve any conflicts.

:::caution

When combining multiple block behaviors, you must also merge their required properties.
