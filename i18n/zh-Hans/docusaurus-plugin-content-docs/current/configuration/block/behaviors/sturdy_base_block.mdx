**Sturdy Base Block** refers to blocks that need a sturdy supporting face. For example, doors won't work on dripstones. Support types include `full`, `rigid`, and `center`.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:pebble:
    behavior:
      type: sturdy_base_block
      direction: down
      support-types:
        - full
```
