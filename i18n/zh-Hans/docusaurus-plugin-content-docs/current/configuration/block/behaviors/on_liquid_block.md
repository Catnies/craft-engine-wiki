**On Liquid Block** is a type of block that can only be placed on the surface of fluid sources. Currently, there are only two fluid options available (water and lava).

```yaml
blocks:
  default:reed:
    behavior:
      type: on_liquid_block
      stackable: false
      liquid-type:
        - water # lava
```
